# Overview
## The purpose of this analysis is to help Alphabet Soup create a model that can predict whether or not an applicant will succeed. The model used will be a deep learning model with multiple neurons, layers, and activation functions.
## Data Preprocessing
### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- IS_SUCCESSFUL
### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- Everything else, except removed input
### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- NAME & EIN where both removed

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- neurons: 80 & 30
- layers: 3
- activation functions: relu & sigmoid
### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- No
### What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
- I didn’t have time to do this as my homework is late and I will need to focus on the project.
# Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis was to select applicants for funding based on their chance of succeeding.

## Summary
### The model that was created could only achieve just under 75% and may be considered acceptable depending on Alphabet Soup’s requirements.

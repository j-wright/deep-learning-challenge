## Data Preprocessing

### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- IS_SUCCESSFUL
### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- Everything else, except removed input
### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- NAME & EIN where both removed

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- neurons: 80 & 30
- layers: 3
- activation functions: relu & sigmoid
### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- No
### What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
- I didnâ€™t have time to do this as my homework is late and I will need to focus on the project.
